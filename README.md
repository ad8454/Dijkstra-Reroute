# Djikastra-Reroute
A simple rerouting program that randomly generates a graph and uses Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path 
between two nodes. The program then quickly reroutes in case of a node faliure. The graphs at each stage were visualized with Java Swing.

**Initial graph:**

**Graph with shortest path between start and end node:**

**Graph with rerouting beacuse of broken node (node faliure):**
